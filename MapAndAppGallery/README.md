### Deploying

1. To deploy this application, download the template from Portal/ArcGIS Online and unzip it.
2. Copy the unzipped folder containing the web app template files, such as index.html, to your web server. You can rename the folder to change the URL through which users will access the application. By default the URL to the app will be `http://<Your Web Server>/<app folder name>/index.html`
3. Change the portalURL, found in config.js, to the sharing URL for ArcGIS Online or Portal. For ArcGIS Online users, use www.arcgis.com or specify the name of your organization.
4. If you are using Portal or a local install of the ArcGIS API for JavaScript, change all references to the ArcGIS API for JavaScript in index.html to refer to your local copy of the API. Search for the references containing `"//jsdev.arcgis.com/3.17"` and replace this portion of the reference with the url to your local install.
  - For example: `"//webadaptor.domain.com/arcgis/jsapi/jsapi"` where `arcgis` is the name of your Web Adaptor.
5. Copy a group ID from Portal/ArcGIS Online and replace the default group ID in the application’s config.js file. You can now run the application on your web server or configure the application further.

> **Note:** If your application edits features in a feature service, contains secure services or web maps that aren't shared publicly, or generate requests that exceed 200 characters, you may need to set up and use a proxy page. Common situations where you may exceed the URL length are using complex polygons as input to a task or specifying a spatial reference using well-known text (WKT). For details on installing and configuring a proxy page see [Using the proxy](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/jshelp/ags_proxy.html). If you do not have an Internet connection, you will need to access and deploy the ArcGIS API for JavaScript documentation from [developers.arcgis.com](https://developers.arcgis.com/).

## Resources

This application uses the 3.16 version of [Esri's ArcGIS API for JavaScript][]; see the site for concepts, samples, and a reference for using the API to create mapping web sites.

[Esri's ArcGIS Online Help][] site describes how to create web maps and web map applications in the ArcGIS Online ecosystem.
