# impact-summary-map-template-js

![App](http://esri.github.io/impact-summary-map-template-js/images/item.png)

This interactive map highlights an area and shows a summary of data related to its location. The data presented in the boxes, at the bottom of the map, can be any integer data allowing you to answer new questions about locations that you cannot answer with maps alone.

For instance, in the web map you could enrich your polygon with demographics, landscape, infrastructure, and other variables using Enrich Layer or analyze your own data with Aggregate Points. Then you can use this template to show your analysis with a simple web mapping application.

The template can be configured using the following options:

- **Map:** Choose the web map to use in your application.
- **Responsive:** A side drawer is shown when its size can be accommodated. The responsive drawer can be toggled on or off by the user and allows the application to be embedded into blogs and websites.
- **Navigation:** Home and Locate buttons add ease of map navigation.
- **Content:** Summarize integer data by choosing a FeatureService layer containing the fields. A layer containing multiple features and has a renderer defined allows for selecting the features by the renderer values. An interactive dashboard provides ability to categorize fields in up to 4 group panels and page through the fields.
- **Summary:** Briefly describe your application in the "Area" panel.
- **Search:** Enable Searching for addresses and places.
- **Share:** Share this application through Twitter, Facebook, Google+ or generate HTML for embedding in a blog or website.
- **Basemap:** Enable toggling between two Esri basemaps.
- **Layers:** Toggle visibility of layers.
- **Legend:** Display a legend.
- **About:** Display information about the application. The dialog can also be set to open on startup.

## Webfonts

This application uses a custom webfont created on [Fontello](http://fontello.com/). If you're hosting this application on your own server, make sure that it's configured to host the webfont files with the correct mime types. Some servers require a mime type set for these files to be able to serve them correctly. See the following URLs for more information. There is a zip archive of the webfont with it's fontello config in the "resources" folder in this repository.
